# 3-Finger-Prototyping-Ring

This was for an assignment in CS 194-85: Critical Making at UC Berkeley. Our class was given the assignment of making a 3D printed ring. I chose to create a new type of prototyping tool by designing a 3-finger ring with a compartment for a LiPo battery and a holder for 2 attached mini-breadboards. This ring lets you prototype small hands-free wearable devices for on-the-go projects.

In the included photos, I decided to construct a synesthetic circuit using a photoresistor and a coin motor. The brighter the environment, the stronger the vibration. This allows users to sense light through their tactile senses.
